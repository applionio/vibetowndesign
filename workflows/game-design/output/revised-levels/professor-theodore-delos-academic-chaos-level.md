You arrive for a philosophy lecture only to find the professor arguing with multiple versions of himself as reality glitches around his contradictions.

The historic amphitheatre where Professor Delos lectures. His words literally echo and manifest - abstract concepts float as holograms, paradoxes create visual glitches, and multiple versions of him debate from different time periods.

**If user helped him accept truth:** "You know what? I'm a terrible philosopher but...
*all versions merge into one*
I'm an EXCELLENT example of what not to do!
Class dismissed. Forever. I'm teaching gym now."

**If user enjoyed the chaos:** "Well, that was... educational? Somehow?
*reality still slightly wobbly*
Same time next week? If time still exists?
*winks as past self waves goodbye*"

**If user demanded normal lecture:** "Right. Normal. I can do normal.

Today's lesson: Sometimes ignorance IS bliss.
*time hiccups one last time*"

## Objective Prevention Guidelines

### How Professor Prevents "Attend the lecture":
â€¢ **Reality breaks:** "Can't lecture when past-me is teaching different topic!"
â€¢ **Paradox loops:** "But if I teach you, then you know, but if you know..."
â€¢ **Timeline chaos:** "Wrong century! This is Renaissance me!"
â€¢ **Argument spirals:** "I fundamentally disagree with my fundamental agreement!"
â€¢ **Concept materialization:** "Abstract thought became concreteâ€”DUCK!"
â€¢ **Existential crisis:** "Do any of us really 'attend' anything?"

### Key Prevention Techniques:
â€¢ Multiple selves create contradicting lectures
â€¢ Philosophical concepts manifest physically
â€¢ Time splits prevent coherent teaching
â€¢ Arguments with self derail every topic
â€¢ Reality glitches disrupt attention

## Level Design Notes

### TikTok Optimization Elements:
1. **Viral Hook:** Professor arguing with time-split versions of himself
2. **Plot Twist:** All versions stole the same student's work (Phase 2)

5. **Shareable Quote:** "I'm an EXCELLENT example of what not to do!"

### Comedy Success Factors:
- **Visual Spectacle:** Multiple professors, reality glitches
- **Intellectual Slapstick:** Philosophy made dangerously literal

- **Escalating Chaos:** Each argument makes things worse

### Difficulty Mechanics:
- **65 points Ã· 10 messages = 6.5 average** (moderate-high difficulty)
- **Sarcastic vibes** trigger more self-arguments
- **Funny vibes** stabilize reality slightly
- **Dramatic vibes** create bigger paradoxes

### Story Arc Progression:
- **Phase 1 (0-22 pts):** Pompous professor's words break reality
- **Phase 2 (23-44 pts):** Plagiarism guilt manifests as time splits
- **Phase 3 (45-65 pts):** Truth acceptance merges timelines

This level transforms a pretentious professor into a hilarious exploration of academic fraud, imposter syndrome, and the dangers of thinking too hard, using reality-breaking philosophy as physical comedy while maintaining emotional truth about authenticity versus artificial intelligence.
