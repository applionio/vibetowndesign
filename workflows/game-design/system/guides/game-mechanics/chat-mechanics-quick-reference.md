## Priority Design Targets

### **URGENT (0 levels currently):**
1. **HERDING CATS** (CONVINCE + REDIRECT)
   - Character constantly changes subject when player tries to persuade
   - Example: "Get artist to finish commission" but they discuss everything except art

2. **COMEDIC PRISON** (ESCAPE + OVERWHELM/DELAY)
   - Player wants to leave but character creates reasons to stay
   - Example: "End conversation with lonely neighbor" but they keep adding activities

### **HIGH PRIORITY (underrepresented):**
3. **INFORMATION TSUNAMI** (Any + OVERWHELM)
   - Character gives too much information/help at once
   - Example: "Learn museum facts" but guide shares entire encyclopedia

4. **FRIENDLY RIVALRY** (Any + COMPETE)
   - Character turns everything into playful competition
   - Example: "Get workout advice" but trainer makes it all contests

**Player Feels**: "I'm uncovering secrets piece by piece"
**Avoid**: We have too many of these already

### **PROVING GROUND** üí™ (Balanced)
**Formula**: Any Intention + TEST
**Player Feels**: "I need to earn their respect/trust through challenges"
**Use**: Sparingly, good variety already

### **INFORMATION TSUNAMI** üåä (INCREASE)
**Formula**: Any Intention + OVERWHELM
**Player Feels**: "Too much happening at once, I need to navigate the chaos!"
**Use**: Create 2-3 more levels with this experience

**Formula**: Any Intention + COMPETE
**Player Feels**: "Everything's a fun contest, let's see who wins!"

### **HERDING CATS** üê± (CREATE)
**Formula**: CONVINCE/HELP/LEARN + REDIRECT

### **COMEDIC PRISON** üîê (CREATE)
**Formula**: ESCAPE + OVERWHELM/DELAY
**Player Feels**: "I want to leave but they won't let me!"

## Character Type Suggestions

- Overeager Tour Guide (end tour, they extend indefinitely)
- Desperate Salesperson (decline offer, they sweeten deal)

#### **INFORMATION TSUNAMI Characters:**
- Enhanced Librarian (ask for book, get entire database)
- Time Traveler (ask about past, experience all history)
- Psychic Reader (want fortune, receive universal consciousness)

#### **FRIENDLY RIVALRY Characters:**

## Quick Level Design Checklist

### **Before Creating New Level:**
1. ‚úÖ Check matrix - avoid OBSTACLE COURSE and DETECTIVE
2. ‚úÖ Choose HERDING CATS or COMEDIC PRISON if possible
3. ‚úÖ Ensure character's profession fits response pattern
4. ‚úÖ Design prevention mechanics that are funny, not frustrating
5. ‚úÖ Include emotional core explaining why character behaves this way

### **Validation Questions:**
- Does this create a new feeling the player hasn't experienced?
- Would this feel different from our existing levels?
- Does the character's response pattern match their personality?
- Can we sustain this interaction for 10-12 messages?
- Is there clear emotional growth/resolution?

This matrix ensures every new VibeTown level creates a genuinely different gameplay experience while maintaining the town's emotional depth and comedy balance.
