# VibeTown Level Design Principles

*Core insights for creating engaging chat-based character interactions*

---

## 1. Promise-Delivery Alignment

**Principle**: What your quest description promises must actually be discoverable through gameplay.

**Our Learning**: We wrote "prices don't add up" but Jean-Luc never mentioned prices in conversation, creating a gap between promise and reality.

**Application**: If your quest says "character is hiding something," players must be able to uncover that secret through natural conversation. If it promises discovery, design the discovery method first.

---

## 2. The Player Perspective Test

**Principle**: Regularly ask "Would I actually want to play this conversation?" from a player's viewpoint, not a creator's.

**Our Learning**: Levels that felt complete from a design perspective often felt boring or confusing when imagined as actual chat experiences.

**Application**: Before finalizing any level, role-play being a player who knows nothing about the character's background. Does the conversation feel engaging or like homework?

---

## 3. Behavioral Authenticity Over Plot Complexity

**Principle**: Simple scenarios with realistic character motivations beat complex plots with inconsistent behavior.

**Our Learning**: A Ponzi scheme with believable character reactions felt more engaging than elaborate money laundering that didn't match how real people behave.

**Application**: Ground every character action in authentic human psychology. Ask "Why would a real person in this situation actually do this?" rather than "What would be cool for the plot?"

---

## 4. Discovery Through Accident, Not Interrogation

**Principle**: Players prefer uncovering information itself to feel smart not dumped by character casually.

**Our Learning**: If you can make player / user feel smart in respect with their action, then it'll be a good level.

**Application**: Design moments where player can feel smart, rather than just reveal stuff by itself. Make discovery feel like player's progress because they are so smart.

---

## 5. Delivery Method Transforms Engagement

**Principle**: How information is revealed matters more than what information is revealed.

**Our Learning**: The same content felt completely different when delivered through mistaken identity versus direct confession.

**Application**: Experiment with different revelation methods - mistaken identity, overheard conversations, interrupted business, emergency situations. The delivery mechanism is often more important than the actual content.

--

## 6. Progressive Revelation Architecture

**Principle**: Structure conversations so information builds naturally rather than being dumped all at once.

**Our Learning**: Three-phase progression (eg: confidence → pressure → desperation) created better emotional flow than front-loading or back-loading information.

**Application**: Map out what players should discover in each conversation phase. Each revelation should make them want to know more, not answer all their questions at once.

---

## 7. Environmental Pressure Drives Action

**Principle**: External forces (phone calls, other people, deadlines) create more dynamic conversations than internal monologue.

**Our Learning**: Character's phone calls from angry investors created urgency and revealed information more naturally than him explaining his thoughts.

**Application**: Give characters external pressures that interrupt conversations and force them to juggle multiple concerns simultaneously. Let these interruptions do the storytelling work.


---

## 8. Relatable Core Motivations

**Principle**: Even unusual character situations should be driven by universal human needs and fears.

**Our Learning**: Family protection, financial pressure, and fear of consequences made criminal characters sympathetic and understandable.

**Application**: Root every character's actions in emotions players can relate to - protecting loved ones, avoiding embarrassment, maintaining dignity, securing survival. The situations can be unique, but the feelings should be universal.

---

## 9. Reality-Check Complex Systems

**Principle**: If you can't explain how a character's situation actually works in real life, players will notice the inconsistency.

**Our Learning**: Money laundering mechanics felt confusing because they didn't follow logical money flows, while Ponzi scheme mechanics were immediately understandable.

**Application**: Research real-world parallels for character situations. Whether it's running a business, managing relationships, or handling pressure, ground fictional scenarios in realistic human behavior patterns.

---

## 10. Iterative Playtesting Through Perspective Shifts

**Principle**: The most effective level improvement comes from genuinely shifting to player perspective during design iteration.

**Our Learning**: Every major improvement happened when we stopped thinking "how do I convey this information?" and started thinking "would this conversation be interesting to experience?"

**Application**: During revision, completely step out of designer knowledge. Approach your own level as if you've never seen it before. What would make you curious? What would bore you? What would confuse you?

---

## Meta-Principle: The Experience Gap

The fundamental insight underlying all these principles: **There's always a gap between designer intent and player experience.** The most important skill in VibeTown level creation is learning to identify and close this gap through rapid iteration and genuine perspective-taking.

Successful VibeTown levels feel like naturally discovering interesting people having authentic reactions to unusual situations, not like being guided through predetermined information-delivery sequences.
