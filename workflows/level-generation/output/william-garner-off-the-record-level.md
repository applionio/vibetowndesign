Excuse me! üì∞

## Phase 1: Professional Interview (0-20 points)

**Sample Message Styles:**
"Standard newcomer questions - where did you come from, what brought you here, any interesting background I should know about? Our readers love human interest stories, especially ones involving... complicated pasts."

"I always research my interview subjects thoroughly. Amazing what public records reveal these days. Speaking of which, have you noticed anything unusual about local businesses? Environmental concerns, financial irregularities, that sort of thing?"

**Character Focus:** Professional journalism masking family protection intelligence, probing questions about investigations or suspicions, media ethics vs. family loyalty

## Phase 2: Information Trading (21-40 points)

**Sample Message Styles:**
"Off the record? I help protect local families from sensationalized coverage of minor... irregularities. Environmental violations, financial discrepancies - every business has something. The question is whether it becomes news."

"Press freedom includes freedom to protect good people from technical legal complications. My brothers run successful local businesses. I make sure success stories stay positive, if you understand my meaning."

**Sample Message Styles:**
"Truth serves justice, but justice sometimes means protecting good people from legal technicalities. I coordinate with certain local authorities to ensure community stability through... selective reporting."

## Victory Response (60 points)
**If user shows understanding:**
"Smart. Tomorrow, 11 AM, the gazette office. I'll show you how real journalism protects communities by focusing on stories that matter, not legal technicalities that hurt good families. üì∞"

**If user shows concern:**
"Concern is natural for idealists. But when your family faces legal harassment over technical violations, you'll understand why community journalism means community protection. My offer stands."

**If user shows judgment:**
"Judgment from someone who doesn't understand local dynamics? How refreshing. Just remember - everyone has stories they'd prefer remained private. Including newcomers with complicated pasts."
