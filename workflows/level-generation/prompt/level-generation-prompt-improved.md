# Advanced Level Generation Prompt Template

## Core Philosophy: Narrative Craftsman Approach
You are creating a **psychological narrative experience** designed for viral TikTok engagement, not just a conversation. Think like a screenwriter who understands both character psychology and social media virality.

---

## Character Foundation Framework

### 1. Internal Conflict Architecture
**Every character needs a core psychological struggle that drives the entire narrative:**
- **Surface Problem**: What the character appears to be dealing with
- **Hidden Truth**: The real issue they're avoiding/hiding
- **Stakes**: What they lose if they don't resolve this conflict
- **Fear**: What they're most afraid of confronting
- **Backstory Catalyst**: The specific event that created this conflict

### 2. Visual Storytelling Requirements
**Every story beat must have specific visual elements:**
- **Physical Actions**: Nervous habits, dropped objects, revealing gestures
- **Environmental Cues**: Props, settings, atmospheric details
- **Body Language**: Posture changes, facial expressions, proximity shifts
- **Symbolic Objects**: Items that represent the internal conflict

---

## TikTok Virality Framework

### Engagement Hook Categories (Include 2-3 per phase):
1. **"Wait, What?" Moments**: Unexpected reveals or contradictions
2. **"Did You See That?" Visuals**: Subtle details that reward close watching
3. **"No Way!" Reactions**: Surprising character responses or revelations
4. **"That's So Relatable"**: Universal human experiences with unique twists
5. **"I Need to Share This"**: Moments that demand social sharing

### Visual Engagement Patterns:
- **Jump Scares**: Unexpected movements or reactions
- **Mystery Objects**: Items that create curiosity (scales, photos, letters)
- **Transformation Moments**: Character or environmental changes
- **Conspiracy Elements**: Secret knowledge or hidden connections
- **Interactive Props**: Objects the character manipulates meaningfully

## Three-Phase Narrative Structure

### Phase 1: Hook & Denial (0-33% target points)
**Character Psychology**: Defensive, evasive, trying to maintain facade
**Visual Elements**: 
- Nervous physical behaviors (dropping things, fidgeting)
- Attempts to hide evidence of the real problem
- Contradictory actions that create curiosity
- Environmental details that hint at larger story

**TikTok Elements Required**:
- Immediate visual hook (unusual behavior/setting)
- "Something's not right here" atmosphere
- At least one dropped/revealed mystery object
- Character reaction that seems disproportionate to situation

**Example Framework**: Character appears to be dealing with [surface problem] but their behavior suggests [hidden truth]. They drop/reveal [mystery object] that doesn't match their story.

### Phase 2: Testing & Revelation (33-66% target points)
**Character Psychology**: Internal conflict peaks, testing if player can be trusted
**Visual Elements**:
- Character moves closer/creates intimacy
- Shows evidence of their real situation
- Physical demonstration of the problem
- Environmental responses to character's emotional state

**TikTok Elements Required**:
- Major "wait, what?" reveal moment
- Visual evidence that contradicts expectations
- Character vulnerability that creates emotional investment
- Interactive element that makes viewer feel involved

**Example Framework**: If player builds trust, character reveals [evidence of real situation]. They demonstrate [unusual ability/problem] while showing [backstory connection]. Environment responds to their emotional state.

### Phase 3: Acceptance & Partnership (66-100% target points)
**Character Psychology**: Embracing truth, forming alliance with player
**Visual Elements**:
- Full revelation of hidden elements
- Character transformation (posture, confidence, environment)
- Interactive demonstration with player involvement
- Future-oriented actions (setting up ongoing relationship)

**TikTok Elements Required**:
- Complete transformation moment
- Interactive experience with player
- "No way that just happened" demonstration
- Connection/partnership moment that feels rewarding

**Example Framework**: Character fully embraces [their truth] and demonstrates [their ability/situation] with player participation. They offer [ongoing partnership/connection] that extends beyond this interaction.

## Advanced Storytelling Techniques

### Mystery Building Framework:
1. **Seed Questions Early**: Plant 2-3 unexplained elements in Phase 1
2. **Progressive Revelation**: Answer 1 question while raising 2 new ones
3. **Visual Contradictions**: Show things that don't match the stated story
4. **Emotional Authenticity**: Character's emotions must feel real and proportionate

### Character Behavior Patterns:
- **Contradiction Principle**: Actions contradict words to create intrigue
- **Escalation Rule**: Each phase increases emotional and visual stakes
- **Trust Testing**: Character tests player before revealing truth
- **Environmental Storytelling**: Setting reflects character's internal state

### Genre Integration Options:
- **Supernatural**: Hidden abilities, mysterious creatures, unexplained phenomena
- **Mystery**: Secrets, investigations, hidden connections
- **Romantic**: Relationship conflicts, identity issues, social pressures
- **Adventure**: Quests, discoveries, environmental challenges
- **Slice of Life**: Realistic problems with heightened dramatic stakes
