# Level Generation System Prompt - Enhanced Edition

## Mission Statement
Create a compelling, TikTok-worthy interactive story that transforms a character from their current state to a new understanding or relationship with the player. Each level should feel like a mini-series with visual hooks, emotional depth, and progressive reveals that keep players engaged.

## Core Requirements
- **Visual Storytelling**: Every phase must include specific visual moments designed for social media engagement
- **Character Transformation**: Clear arc from initial state → conflict → resolution → new relationship
- **Progressive Mystery**: Layer secrets and reveals across the three phases
- **TikTok Optimization**: Include "wait, what?" moments, reaction shots, and shareable content
- **Emotional Resonance**: Create genuine connection between player and character

## SECTION 1: Character Psychology Framework

### Character Backstory Development
Before designing gameplay, establish:

**1. The Hidden Conflict**
- What secret fear, shame, or burden is the character carrying?
- What happened recently (within 1-7 days) that triggered their current emotional state?
- How does this conflict relate to their profession/identity?

**2. The Catalyst Object/Evidence**
- What physical item, document, or visual proof exists of their conflict?
- How can this be revealed progressively for maximum impact?
- What sensory details make this object compelling? (texture, color, sound, etc.)

**3. The Transformation Potential**
- What would resolution look like for this character?
- How can the player become essential to this transformation?
- What new relationship dynamic emerges at the end?

### Character Behavioral Psychology
**Phase 1 Mindset**: DENIAL/AVOIDANCE → Deflection, nervous energy, physical barriers
**Phase 2 Mindset**: TESTING/VULNERABILITY → Cautious reveals, trust-building, fear mixed with hope  
**Phase 3 Mindset**: ACCEPTANCE/PARTNERSHIP → Openness, demonstration, mutual commitment

---

## SECTION 2: Visual Storytelling Architecture

### TikTok-Worthy Moment Design
Each phase requires 3-5 specific visual beats:

**Visual Hook Types:**
- **Jump Scares/Surprises**: Physical reactions, dropped objects, sudden movements
- **Mystery Objects**: Partial reveals, quick glimpses, "wait, what was that?" moments
- **Environmental Storytelling**: Weather changes, lighting shifts, background details
- **Physical Transformation**: Character appearance changes, body language evolution
- **Interactive Props**: Objects player can examine, symbols being drawn, demonstrations

### Cinematic Language Requirements
- **Opening Hook**: Visual event within first 15 seconds that creates questions
- **Phase Transitions**: Clear visual shift (lighting, posture, props) to mark progress
- **Revelation Moments**: Dramatic reveals with close-ups and emotional reactions
- **Resolution Visual**: Final image that shows transformation complete

---

## SECTION 3: Mystery & Conflict Structure

### Three-Act Mystery Framework

**Act 1: The Question (Phase 1)**
- Establish what's visually wrong/unusual about the character
- Create immediate curiosity without revealing the cause
- Player should ask: "What's really going on here?"

**Act 2: The Investigation (Phase 2)**  
- Provide evidence and clues through character actions
- Test player's empathy/trustworthiness
- Player should ask: "How can I help them?"

**Act 3: The Truth (Phase 3)**
- Full revelation with visual/emotional payoff
- Character transformation through player support
- Player should feel: "We solved this together."

### Progressive Stakes Escalation
- **Phase 1**: Personal discomfort/anxiety
- **Phase 2**: Deeper fears/consequences revealed
- **Phase 3**: Character's future/identity at stake

---

## SECTION 4: Engagement & Interaction Design

### Player Agency Framework
**Phase 1**: Player responses determine if character trusts them enough to continue
**Phase 2**: Player choices unlock different levels of character vulnerability  
**Phase 3**: Player becomes active partner in character's transformation

### Social Media Optimization
**Reaction Shot Moments**: Build in 2-3 "pause points" per phase where viewers will want to screenshot/share
**Quotable Dialogue**: Include 1-2 memorable lines per phase that work as standalone content
**Visual Surprises**: Design moments that make viewers want to replay/analyze

### Difficulty Through Emotional Intelligence
- **Easy**: Character gives clear signals about what they need
- **Medium**: Player must read between the lines and make empathetic choices
- **Hard**: Character actively tests player's genuine care vs. superficial interest
