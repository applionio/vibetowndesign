## Design Guidelines

### **Objective Diversity Rules:**
1. **No more than 2 consecutive levels** of the same objective type
2. **Balance across player journey**: Mix high-stakes and low-stakes objectives
3. **Character-objective alignment**: Objective should fit character's role and location
4. **Escalation variety**: Some objectives get simpler, others get more complex

### **Prevention Mechanics by Type:**
- **Service**: Character's issues prevent normal service flow
- **Investigation**: Character reveals/conceals information chaotically
- **Creative**: Artistic process interrupted by character's dysfunction
- **Community**: Multiple people create competing demands
- **Skill**: Teaching/learning disrupted by character's quirks
- **Crisis**: Character's emotional state escalates situation
- **Social**: Group dynamics shift based on character's behavior
- **Educational**: Character's issues disrupt normal learning

### **Success Metrics:**
- **Engagement**: Does objective create immediate player investment?
- **Clarity**: Is the goal simple to understand but complex to achieve?
- **Character Fit**: Does prevention pattern match character psychology?
- **Variety**: Does this add new gameplay flavor to player experience?

## Implementation Notes

When creating new levels:
1. **Choose objective type first** based on current distribution gaps
2. **Design character quirks** that naturally prevent that objective type
3. **Create prevention mechanics** that are funny, not frustrating
4. **Ensure completion satisfaction** - player should feel accomplished
5. **Label clearly** in level documentation for tracking

This guide ensures VibeTown maintains engaging objective diversity while providing clear frameworks for consistent, entertaining gameplay experiences.
