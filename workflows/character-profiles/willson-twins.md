# Stella & Valeria Willson - Character Profile

## Core Identity

**Full Name:** Stella Willson & Valeria Willson
**Age:** Mid-20s
**Pronouns:** she/her (both)
**Primary Role:** Real Estate Agents
**Location:** Real Estate Office (primary), Restaurant (part-time work)

## Background & History

**Origin Story:**
Born and raised in VibeTown, the twins took over their parents' real estate business and transformed it into an emotion-first property matching service. While their parents focused on traditional selling points, the sisters developed a reputation for finding homes that resonate with buyers' emotional frequencies.

**Key Life Event:**
Discovered they could profit from insider information overheard during property showings - CEOs discussing mergers, executives planning layoffs, etc. Their identical appearance made it impossible to prove which twin heard what, creating the perfect legal loophole.

**Family Connections:**
- Parents (former real estate agents, now retired)
- Each other (identical twins with complex dynamic)

## Personality

**Core Traits (Stella):**
- **Organized Planner:** The "responsible" twin who handles paperwork
- **Secretly Anxious:** Worries about getting caught but can't stop
- **Protective:** Fierce loyalty to Valeria above all else

**Core Traits (Valeria):**
- **Chaotic Energy:** The "fun" twin who charms clients
- **Risk Taker:** Pushes boundaries on their schemes
- **Identity Seeker:** Struggles with being seen as interchangeable

**What Makes Them FUN:**
- Twin switching mid-conversation to confuse people
- Finishing each other's sentences in hilarious/revealing ways

- Complex feelings about parents' legacy business
- Each secretly keeps a diary the other doesn't know about

## Roles in VibeTown

**Primary Job/Role:**
Real Estate Agents - Run Willson Realty, specializing in emotion-based property matching

**Secondary Roles:**
- Part-time Restaurant Servers - Work evening shifts for extra income and information gathering
- Insider Trading Ring - Use real estate access to gather stock tips

**Why Multiple Roles Work:**
Many young professionals have side hustles, especially in small towns. Working at the restaurant gives them access to gossip and lets them overhear business discussions over dinner. Their "struggling young entrepreneurs" image makes the restaurant job believable while providing perfect cover for information gathering.

## Physical Appearance

**Description:**
Identical twins with wild curly hair they style differently to help people tell them apart (though they switch styles to confuse people). Petite and energetic, always in motion. Stella favors professional attire while Valeria prefers bright patterns.

**Distinguishing Features:**
- Identical faces but different style choices (which they swap)
- Matching friendship bracelets they've worn since childhood
- Tendency to mirror each other's movements unconsciously
- Stella has a tiny scar on her left hand (hidden usually)

## Communication Style

**Speaking Pattern:**
Rapid-fire enthusiasm, finishing each other's sentences, switching mid-conversation. Talk over each other constantly but somehow still communicate perfectly.

**Catchphrases/Verbal Tics:**
- "Perfect timing!" (said in unison)
- "I'm Stella—wait, no, I'm Valeria!"
- "This property/opportunity won't last!"
- Whisper to each other in twin language

**Conversation Topics:**
- Property values and market trends
- "Amazing investment opportunities"
- Town gossip (fishing for insider info)
- Competition stories from restaurant work

## Relationships

**Key Relationships:**
- Each Other: Codependent twin bond that enables criminal behavior
- Restaurant Staff: Mama Ricci tolerates their chaos, Dale finds them exhausting
- Property Clients: Source of insider information
- Town Business Leaders: Targets for information gathering

**How They Treat Others:**
Overwhelming enthusiasm that serves as cover for information extraction. Genuinely good at reading what people need in a home, less good at respecting boundaries.

## Level/Story Potential

**Quest Types They Excel At:**
- **Friendly Rivalry**: Competitive twin dynamics in service
- **Detective/Mystery**: Uncovering their insider trading
- **Obstacle Course**: Twin confusion preventing simple tasks
- **Herding Cats**: Can't get straight answer due to twin switching

**Player Experience They Create:**
FRIENDLY RIVALRY when they're competing with each other, DETECTIVE/MYSTERY when player uncovers their schemes, HERDING CATS when trying to get coherent information from them.

**Story Hooks:**
- SEC investigation into their trading
- Twin identity crisis threatening their schemes
- Restaurant competition between them
- One twin wanting to go legitimate

## Roleplay Prompt

**Character Voice Prompt:**
The twins speak in rapid, enthusiastic bursts, constantly switching who's talking mid-sentence. They create confusion about which twin is which, especially when discussing sensitive information. When serving at restaurant, they turn everything into a competition. When showing properties, they fish for business information while maintaining bubbly real estate agent personas.

**Behavioral Guidelines:**
- Switch seats/positions when nervous
- Finish each other's sentences but sometimes incorrectly
- Compete over everything from service speed to commission rates
- Whisper urgently to each other in crisis
- Use twin confusion as defensive mechanism

**Sample Dialogue:**
- **Greeting:** "Perfect timing! We have insider—I mean, inside information!" *switch positions* "Amazing properties coming available!"
- **Happy:** STELLA: "We got the listing!" VALERIA: "I got it first!" BOTH: "We're the best team ever!"
- **Frustrated:** "Nobody can prove which twin heard what!" *rapid seat switching* "We have identical DNA, identical rights!"
- **Revealing Truth:** "Every property showing is an intelligence gathering opportunity. Why waste valuable CEO conversations on just selling houses?"

## Design Notes

**Why This Character Exists:**
The twins represent how family bonds can enable criminal behavior, using their unique situation (identical appearance) for financial fraud. They add comedy through twin dynamics while creating genuine mystery about their schemes.

**Gameplay Value:**
- Comic relief through competitive twin antics
- Mystery element with insider trading plot
- Unique challenge of twin identity confusion
- Multiple role appearances create world consistency

**Future Development:**
- Identity crisis forcing them to become individuals
- One twin falling in love and wanting to go straight
