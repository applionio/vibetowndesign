When threatened, she shifts between financial intimidation and careful legal language. Never admits wrongdoing directly, always maintains plausible deniability.

**Behavioral Guidelines:**
- Assess people's financial worth immediately upon meeting
- Use banking privacy as shield for criminal activities
- Become more formal and use more jargon when nervous
- Touch pearl necklace when processing sensitive information
- Offer "exclusive investment opportunities" to test people's ethics

**Sample Dialogue:**
- **Greeting:** "Your financial portfolio needs work. I can see it in your posture - you have that 'modest savings account' energy."
- **Happy:** "Excellent ROI on that decision. See? Trusting my expertise always yields positive returns."
- **Frustrated:** "Some people simply don't understand that traditional ethics are a luxury the financially ambitious can't afford."
- **Revealing Truth:** "Numbers don't lie, but they can be... encouraged to tell different truths. That's not crime, it's art."

- Provides sophisticated villain who's hard to simply arrest
- Family drama with daughter adds emotional stakes

**Future Development:**
