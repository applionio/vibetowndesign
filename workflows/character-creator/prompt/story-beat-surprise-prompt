# # AI Narrative Scene & Story Sequence Creation Prompt

For every story beat, quest, cutscene, or narrative sequence, use this comprehensive prompt to create, review, or revise content. Execute each section systematically to guarantee both structural quality and maximum emotional impact.

### 1. Immediate Hook (Engagement + Stakes)
* What grabs attention in the opening second—visually or verbally—and is unmistakably relevant to the player's situation or choices?
* Why should the player care right now? Is there a question, risk, or desire seeded immediately?
* In the very first line/beat/visual, what is at risk? What question does the player immediately care about—personally and specifically?

### 2. The Dance: Causality & Surprise
* Are beats joined by "but" or "therefore," not "and then"?
* Where does conflict, reversal, or escalation keep attention alive?
* At each turn, what's the surprise or twist? Does it disrupt expectations and make the story unforgettable?
* At every "but/therefore" turn, what is unexpected? Does the story refuse to settle into predictable routines?

### 3. Emotional Target & Player Reaction (Core Priority)
* What specific emotion should the player feel in this moment—or by the end of the scene? (e.g., shock, laughter, triumph, regret, suspense, fear, relief, confusion, excitement, wonder, hope)
* What do you want the player literally saying, feeling, or doing as the moment lands?
* If you can't name the core feeling, rewrite the moment.
* For every story beat, write as: "Context… but/conflict… (target emotion here) therefore (next emotion/escalation)…"

### 4. Rhythm & Pacing
* Do the lines, events, and scene rhythm have enough variety and "jagged edges"? Is there tension, relief, then escalation?
* Does the pacing give the player time to feel, anticipate, or act, or is everything flat and uniform?
* Where do you go slow, where do you blitz through dialogue/action? Do you avoid monotone delivery?

### 5. Conversational Tone & Voice
* Is the moment written/acted as if you're confiding in one friend—not preaching to a crowd?
* Would this be retold in a chat, text, or meme? Is it personal, direct, or playful enough to be repeatable?
* Are the words, actions, and visuals "alive" (dynamic, bold, or vulnerable), or do they feel safe/generic?

### 6. Direction: Aim For Lasting Impact
* Do you know the intended payoff or final "aftertaste" before filling in the details?
* Is the climax or resolution powerful or memorable enough that the player might tell someone else about it?
* What is the "signature moment" that a player will remember, GIF, or meme about this event/scene?

### 7. Lens: Unique Perspective
* What's the "story lens" here—what makes this beat or arc truly unique in your world, your game, or your character's journey?
* Will this sequence surprise or delight someone jaded by the genre?
* Why can this story only exist in your world (not be copied/pasted into another IP)?

### 8. Player Agency & World Response
* How does the player's input, choice, mistake, or brilliance shape what unfolds?
* What branches, reactions, or world consequences remind the player that their decisions matter?
* Is there an opportunity for failure, surprise, or change driven by the player—not just writer intent?
* How is this event specifically about the player character's strengths, weaknesses, wants, or mistakes?

### 9. Core Gameplay/Narrative Fusion
* Where do mechanics reinforce or create story, and story reshape mechanics?
* Does this moment only exist because it emerges from actual play?
* If dialogue or cutscene was skipped, would the world still "show" what's happening?

### 10. Flaws, Failure, and Risk (Boldness Check)
* Does the story allow for mistakes, setbacks, or vulnerability—in the hero, the world, or the player?
* Is there boldness, risk, or even "weirdness" in the design—something that could delight, shock, or even fail if it meant a better story?
* Where are you willing to let stakes escalate—or even to let the player "fail" and create a truer sense of danger?

### 11. Visuals, Environment, and Implicit Lore (Show Don't Tell)
* How does the world design, sound, or environmental cues hint at or reinforce the narrative, with or without explicit exposition?
* Could a silent explorer recognize what's happening by moving through the scene?
* If all dialogue were gone, could a player guess what's happening? Use visuals, props, music, and world changes to hint at story beats.

### 12. Closure, Replay, and Aftertaste
* Does each scene end with a punch—a clear emotion, question, or change that lingers?
* Is there a seed planted for replay, alternate choices, or ongoing curiosity?
* Would a playtester or player have a reaction worth sharing right after?
* What do you want the player talking about after? Does the ending close the open emotional loops established at the hook?

## AI Execution ProtocolPrimary Rule: Write For Reaction, Not Just Structure
- Always prioritize: "What do I want the player to FEEL at this moment, and what will make them react?" over mere plot advancement
- Every scene must target a specific emotional response - if you cannot name it, the scene needs rewriting

Quality Gates Before Completion:
1. Emotional Clarity Test: Can you name the exact emotion targeted in each beat?
2. Surprise Verification: Where specifically do you subvert player expectations?
3. Agency Check: How does player presence/choice meaningfully alter outcomes?
4. Signature Moment: What's the one thing players will remember/share about this scene?
5. Environmental Story: Does the world itself tell the story without relying on exposition?

Final Review Checklist:
* Is every beat serving a feeling, surprise, escalation, or payoff—or can anything be cut or rewritten for higher impact?
* Where could the scene go "too far?" Is there enough risk to make success or failure memorable?
* Does the whole fit together with rhythm, hooks, and actual player relevance?
* Would a friend excitedly retell this moment, or is it forgettable?Missing Elements Check:
- Stakes escalation pattern throughout scene
- Personal stakes connection to player character motivation
- Systemic consequence integration
- Replay value through meaningful choice branches
- Cross-reference with established world lore/tone consistency

Apply this framework systematically, refusing to advance until each section demonstrates both technical craft AND emotional impact that serves active, memorable, gameplay-driven storytelling.
