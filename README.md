# Product & Game Design Workspace

> A streamlined repository focused on documentation for product management and game
> design. All code-specific files have been removed so you can concentrate purely on
> strategy, requirements, and creative design.

## Folder Structure

- **ai-tools**: Tools and guides for working with AI in documentation.
- **guides**: Reference guides for tools & integrations (e.g., Notion, Linear).
- **prompts**: Prompt libraries for AI workflows, categorized into custom and system prompts.
- **templates**: Document, prompt, and game design templates.
- **workflows**: Workflow definitions and automation scripts.
- **logs**: Git-ignored logs / metrics (optional).
- **outputs**: Generated deliverables & exports.
- **README.yml**: Workspace overview (this file).

## Getting Started

- Explore the project structure to understand where different types of content are located.
- Review the `ai-tools/getting-started.yml` for an overview of using AI in this project.
- Check the `guides/` for specific instructions on using tools like Notion and Linear.
- Use the templates in `templates/` to create new documents, prompts, or game design docs.
- For level generation, ask Cascade to generate a level with a character name and location.
- Cascade will follow the workflow documented in `workflows/level-generation/README.md`.

## Workspace Neatness

- Keep the repository simple, clean and clutter-free.
- Group similar files into dedicated folders.
- Place all automation scripts in a dedicated subfolder within `workflows/`.
- Ensure all documentation is in YAML format.
- Remove redundant or outdated files promptly.
- Prefer relative links that reflect the folder structure.

## Recommended Workflow

- **Concept** – Use the automated level generator to create and refine level ideas.
- **Specification** – Use `templates/document-template.yml` to create detailed specifications.
- **Content Creation** – Use prompts from `prompts/` to generate content with AI assistance.
- **Review** – Share documents for feedback.
- **Archive** – Move final versions to `outputs/`.

> **Note:**
> Happy designing! If you need additional structure, create sub-folders as your
> project grows.
