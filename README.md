## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Your Prompt Library

Create prompts in the `prompts/` directory organized by type:
- Technical documentation prompts
- Product specification prompts
- Marketing content prompts
- Research and analysis prompts

### 2. Document Templates

Use templates in `templates/` for consistent formatting:
- PRD template
- API documentation template
- User guide template
- Blog post template

### 3. AI Tool Configuration

Check `config/services.json` for recommended AI tools for different tasks.

## 📝 Best Practices

### Prompt Management
1. **Version Control**: Track changes to prompts over time
2. **Test and Iterate**: Record what works and what doesn't
3. **Context Building**: Maintain context documents in `knowledge-base/`
4. **Reusability**: Create modular prompts that can be combined

### Documentation Workflow
1. **Planning**: Define the documentation goal
2. **Context Gathering**: Collect relevant information
3. **Prompt Selection**: Choose or create appropriate prompts
4. **Generation**: Use AI tools with structured prompts
5. **Review & Edit**: Always review AI-generated content
6. **Archive**: Save outputs for future reference

### AI Tool Selection Guide

| Task Type | Recommended Tool | Why |
|-----------|-----------------|-----|
| Technical Docs | Claude | Better at maintaining accuracy and structure |
| Creative Content | ChatGPT | More creative and varied outputs |
| Research | Perplexity | Provides sources and citations |
| Code Documentation | Claude | Superior code understanding |

## 📊 Tracking AI Usage

Consider tracking:
- Which prompts work best for different tasks
- Time saved using AI assistance
- Quality metrics for generated content
- Cost optimization strategies

## 🔧 Prompt Examples

### Technical Documentation
```markdown
Create comprehensive API documentation for [endpoint].
Include: purpose, parameters, response format, examples, error codes.
Style: Clear, concise, developer-friendly.
```

### Product Specification
```markdown
Write a PRD section for [feature].
Include: user story, acceptance criteria, technical requirements.
Context: [provide context]
```

## 🗂️ Organization Tips

1. **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names like `prompt-api-docs-v2.md`
2. **Metadata**: Include creation date and purpose in prompt files
3. **Categories**: Organize prompts by department/use case
4. **Templates**: Create fill-in-the-blank templates for common tasks

## 📈 Continuous Improvement

- Regularly review and update prompts based on results
- Share successful prompts with your team
- Document lessons learned in `knowledge-base/`
- Create prompt chains for complex documentation tasks

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Never include sensitive data in prompts
- Review AI outputs for accuracy before publishing
- Keep proprietary information in private knowledge base
- Use `.gitignore` for any sensitive configurations
