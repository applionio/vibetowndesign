# Product & Game Design Workspace

A streamlined repository focused on documentation for product management and game design. All code-specific files have been removed so you can concentrate purely on strategy, requirements, and creative design.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Browse `docs/design/` and `docs/product/` to explore existing material.
2. Capture new ideas or specs using the templates in `docs/templates/`.
3. Store helpful references in `docs/resources/` for quick access.
4. Keep AI prompts organised inside `docs/prompts/`.
5. Export final deliverables (e.g.
   pitch decks, GDD extracts) to `outputs/`.

## � Recommended Workflow

1. **Kick-off** – Draft a high-level concept in `docs/design/`.
2. **Scope & Requirements** – Flesh out PRDs in `docs/product/`.
3. **Iterate** – Use AI prompts to draft, refine and review content.
4. **Review** – Share docs via pull requests for feedback.
5. **Archive** – Move approved versions to `outputs/` and tag releases.
