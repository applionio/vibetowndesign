# Product & Game Design Workspace – YAML version

title: "Product & Game Design Workspace"
description: |
  A streamlined repository focused on documentation for product management and game
  design. All code-specific files have been removed so you can concentrate purely on
  strategy, requirements, and creative design.

folder_structure:
  ai-tools: "Tools and guides for working with AI in documentation."
  guides: "Reference guides for tools & integrations (e.g., Notion, Linear)."
  prompts: "Prompt libraries for AI workflows, categorized into custom and system prompts."
  templates: "Document, prompt, and game design templates."
  workflows: "Workflow definitions and automation scripts."
  logs: "Git-ignored logs / metrics (optional)."
  outputs: "Generated deliverables & exports."
  README.yml: "Workspace overview (this file)."

getting_started:
  - "Explore the project structure to understand where different types of content are located."
  - "Review the `ai-tools/getting-started.yml` for an overview of using AI in this project."
  - "Check the `guides/` for specific instructions on using tools like Notion and Linear."
  - "Use the templates in `templates/` to create new documents, prompts, or game design docs."

running_the_level_generator:
  - "Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal."
  - "Create a virtual environment (first time only): `python3 -m venv .venv`"
  - "Activate the environment: `source .venv/bin/activate` (on macOS/Linux)"
  - "Install dependencies (first time only): `pip install -r workflows/level-generator/requirements.txt`"
  - "Run the script: `python workflows/level-generator/generate_level.py`"
  - "Follow the prompts. The output will be saved in the `outputs/` directory."

workspace_neatness:
  - "Keep the repository simple, clean and clutter-free."
  - "Group similar files into dedicated folders."
  - "Place all automation scripts in a dedicated subfolder within `workflows/`."
  - "Ensure all documentation is in YAML format."
  - "Remove redundant or outdated files promptly."
  - "Prefer relative links that reflect the folder structure."

recommended_workflow:
  - "Concept – Use the automated level generator to create and refine level ideas."
  - "Specification – Use `templates/document-template.yml` to create detailed specifications."
  - "Content Creation – Use prompts from `prompts/` to generate content with AI assistance."
  - "Review – Share documents for feedback."
  - "Archive – Move final versions to `outputs/`."

  Happy designing! If you need additional structure, create sub-folders as your
  project grows.
