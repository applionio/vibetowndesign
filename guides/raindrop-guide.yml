  title: "Raindrop.io Quick Guide"
  version: "1.1"
  last_updated: "2025-06-22"
  purpose: "Fast reference for essential Raindrop MCP commands + common gotchas"

basics:
  remember_first:
    - "Every collection or bookmark is referenced by its numeric ID."
    - "Deletion is permanent—double-check IDs before running destructive commands."
    - "If a command returns 404, the item probably doesn't exist or the query is empty."

core_commands:
  collections:
    list: "List all root collections"
    get: "Show details of a collection (needs collectionId)"
    create: "Make a new collection titled [Name]"
    rename: "Rename collection [ID] to [New Name]"
    delete: "Delete collection [ID] (moves items to Unsorted)"
  bookmarks:
    save: "Save https://example.com to collection [ID] with tags: tag1, tag2"
    info: "Show details of bookmark [ID]"
    update: "Change title/tags/move bookmark [ID]"
    search: "Search 'react' in collection [ID] (needs non-empty query)"
    batch: "Move or tag many bookmarks at once (takes list of IDs)"
  tags:
    list: "List all tags (or inside collection [ID])"
    rename: "Rename tag old→new"
  highlights:
    list: "List highlights globally or for bookmark [ID]"
    add: "Add highlight 'Important quote' to bookmark [ID]"
    remove: "Delete highlight [ID]"
  reminders:
    set: "Remind me on 2025-07-01 for bookmark [ID]"
    clear: "Remove reminder from bookmark [ID]"

examples:
  - "List collections → collections.list"
  - "Save https://design.dev to Inbox with tags: css, read-later → bookmarks.save"
  - "Bulk move 10 bookmarks to Resources → bookmarks.batch"
  - "Rename tag 'frontend' to 'web' → tags.rename"

real_world_results:
  - action: collections.list
    output: [Inbox, Resources, Projects, Areas]
  - action: bookmarks.search
    result: "404 when query is empty or collection has no items—add a keyword or check collection"
  - action: highlights.list
    result: "0 highlights (account had none yet)"

troubleshooting:
  - "404? Confirm the ID or include a query string."
  - "Need to filter dates? Use search with createdStart / createdEnd."
  - "No output after save? The URL might be unreachable—try another link."
