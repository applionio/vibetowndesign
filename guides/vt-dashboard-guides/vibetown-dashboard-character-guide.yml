- **Complex Selectors**: Some table actions require direct URL navigation
- **Screenshot Timeouts**: Visual capture sometimes fails

### Working Alternatives ‚úÖ
- **Direct URL Navigation**: Manually construct URLs for specific resources
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Use breadcrumb links for reliable navigation
- **Menu-Based Browsing**: Stick to left sidebar for primary navigation

## Character Types Observed üé≠

### Active Characters (Verified)
```yaml
active_examples:
  - "Stella & Valeria": "Real Estate Agents at Vibecoast Caf√©"
  - "Sergio Marini": "Fisherman at Fisherman's Jetty"

## Technical Implementation Notes üîß

### URL Structure (Tested)
```yaml
url_patterns:
  base: "https://vibetown.applion.us"
  admin_root: "/admin"
  characters: "/admin/characters"
  character_detail: "/admin/characters/{id}"
  users: "/admin/users"  
  user_stories: "/admin/users/{id}/stories"
  places: "/admin/places"
  place_detail: "/admin/places/{id}"
```

### Navigation Reliability
- **‚úÖ Reliable**: Menu links, breadcrumbs, direct URLs
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Inconsistent**: Dynamic buttons, complex table selectors
- **üîß Workaround**: Use direct URL construction when buttons fail

## Best Practices for AI Agents ü§ñ

### Exploration Strategy
1. **Start with Menu Navigation**: Use left sidebar for reliable routing
2. **Document URL Patterns**: Note working URLs for future direct access
3. **Test Interactive Elements**: Verify buttons before relying on them
4. **Use Breadcrumbs**: Reliable for returning to parent sections

### Content Verification
1. **Cross-Reference Data**: Verify character-location relationships
2. **Test User Workflows**: Ensure user stories system works
3. **Monitor System Status**: Note active vs inactive elements
