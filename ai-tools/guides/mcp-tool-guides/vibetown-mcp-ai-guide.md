## üí° Best Practices for AI Agents

### Character Development Strategy
1. **Start with Persona**: Always begin with `edit_character_persona_prompt` to establish foundation
2. **Set Clear Goals**: Use appropriate `target_point` values (60-100 for beginners, 200+ for experienced)
3. **Progressive Revelation**: Design phases to gradually reveal character depth
4. **Consistent Voice**: Maintain character voice across all prompts

### Content Guidelines
- **Phase 1**: Character is guarded, testing player worthiness
- **Phase 2**: Character shares surface-level personal information  
- **Phase 3**: Character reveals vulnerability or deeper connection
- **Victory**: Character offers ongoing relationship or meaningful closure
- **Prevention**: Character maintains boundaries without being cruel

### Technical Considerations
- Always provide `username` parameter for character functions
- Use `place_id` (integer) for place functions, not place name
- Respect character limits to avoid validation errors
- Test story flow by considering point progression thresholds
