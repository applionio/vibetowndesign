## Level Design Notes

**Phase Variety Pattern:** Method Change
- **Phase 1:** Questioning (conversation and probing)
- **Phase 2:** Trading (information exchange)
- **Phase 3:** Observation (discovering through action)

Avoids escalation trap of "ask harder → demand more → interrogate" by using different investigative approaches.
