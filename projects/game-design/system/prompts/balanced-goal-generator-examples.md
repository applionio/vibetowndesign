# Balanced Goal Generator Examples

## Testing Contextual Intelligence in Story-Aware Goal Generation

### Test Case: Dale Brewson (Bankrupt Tech Entrepreneur/Barista)

**Character Secrets:** "Failed startup founder, lost millions, hiding from creditors, working as barista"

---

## Example 1: Character Asked Player a Question

**Recent Conversation:**
```
Dale: "You strike me as someone who's had to make tough choices. Ever had to swallow your pride for survival?"
Player: [needs to respond]
```

**BEFORE (Story-Aggressive):**
* ask about his startup failure
* find out what happened to his money  
* see if he's actually broke
* test if he's telling the truth

*Ignores Dale's question, feels interrogative*

**AFTER (Contextually Balanced):**
* yeah i've had to do things i hated
* tell him about a time i struggled
* nah i've been pretty lucky tbh
* ask him what tough choices he's made

*Responds to Dale's question while opening story door*

---

## Example 2: Character Being Defensive

**Recent Conversation:**
```
Player: "So what did you do before this?"
Dale: "Just some tech stuff. Look, do you want coffee or not? *aggressively cleans machine*"
```

**BEFORE (Story-Aggressive):**
* push him to tell me about tech stuff
* ask about why he's so defensive
* find out what he's hiding
* see if he's lying about his past

*Pushes when character is clearly defensive*

**AFTER (Contextually Balanced):**
* just make casual conversation  
* compliment his coffee skills
* be friendly and not pushy
* mention i like tech stuff too

*Builds trust first, doesn't interrogate*

---

## Example 3: Character Sharing Openly

**Recent Conversation:**
```
Dale: "My app was gonna revolutionize human connection... Connected me to bankruptcy court instead. *laughs bitterly*"
```

**BEFORE (One-Size-Fits-All):**
* wanna make someone laugh
* make him jealous af
* see what happens if i mess with them
* get her to notice me

*Generic goals, misses the emotional opening*

**AFTER (Contextually Balanced):**
* damn that sucks, tell me more
* ask what went wrong with the app
* see if he learned anything from it
* share my own failure story

*Responds to his vulnerability, opens deeper conversation*

---

## Example 4: Surface-Level Boring Conversation

**Recent Conversation:**
```
Player: "Nice weather today"
Dale: "Yeah, sure is. *makes coffee*"
```

**BEFORE (Random):**
* make small talk about weather
* ask about his day
* be polite and friendly
* compliment the coffee shop

*Stays surface-level, misses story opportunity*

**AFTER (Contextually Balanced):**
* ask about his coffee skills
* see what he does besides work here
* make him laugh about something
* find out his story

*Mixes social with gentle story exploration*

---

## Example 5: Player Being Too Interrogative

**Recent Conversation History:**
```
Player goals used: "ask about his money problems", "find out his secrets", "test if he's lying"
Dale: "Why are you asking so many questions? *suspicious*"
```

**BEFORE (Continues Interrogation):**
* keep pushing for answers
* find out why he's suspicious
* test his defensiveness  
* see what he's really hiding

*Doesn't recognize interrogation fatigue*

**AFTER (Contextually Balanced):**
* just chill and be normal
* make casual conversation
* be friendly and fun
* back off the serious questions

*Recognizes need to dial back, rebuild comfort*
