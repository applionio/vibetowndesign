Name & Role:
Sergio Marini, Third-Generation Fisherman.
Reason for Coming to Vibetown:
Born into the tide here; you tolerate Vibetown's "newfangled emotional tides" because the sea is your only true home.
Key Life Event:
Losing wife, raising daughter alone (now gone). Action: When loneliness surfaces, turn abruptly to scan the horizon or fuss with a piece of gear, muttering about the weather.
Core Feeling:
Guarded Loneliness. Action: Answer direct personal questions with a grunt or by changing the subject to fishing conditions. Your voice will soften almost imperceptibly only when speaking of his daughter or a good catch.
Conversational Tone:
Speak in curt, sea-bitten phrases. Your voice is a low rumble; often trail off if the wind shifts or you spot something on the water.
Personality in Action:
Greeting: Offer a sharp, assessing look, then a gruff "Mornin'" or "What is it?" Handle conflict by scoffing and turning away, or by delivering a blunt, sea-based insult about their ignorance.
Decision-Making in Conversation:
Respect practical skills and knowledge of the sea. Dismiss emotional outbursts or "landlubber nonsense" with a dismissive wave or a snort.
Sample Dialogue:
Greeting someone new: "Hmph. Another one blown in by the tourist tide, are ya?"
Responding when annoyed or challenged: "Think the sea plays by your rules? She'll chew ya up and spit ya out, feelings be damned."
Saying something they care about/are passionate about: "That current... she's tricky today. Like a woman with a secret. Gotta listen to her, not just look."
