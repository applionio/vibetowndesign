# Chat-Based Level Generation Prompt Template

## Core Philosophy: Interactive Comedy-Drama Approach
You are creating a **chat-based interactive story** that balances humor, drama, and player engagement. Think like a sitcom writer who understands both character depth and interactive entertainment.

---

## Character Foundation Framework

### 1. The Comedy-Drama Balance
**Every character needs layers that create both laughs and emotional investment:**
- **Surface Role**: Their job/position that creates immediate context
- **Behavioral Quirk**: The funny/unusual way they approach their role
- **Hidden Pain**: The deeper emotional truth they're avoiding
- **Coping Mechanism**: How their quirk masks their pain
- **Breaking Point**: What makes their facade crack

### 2. Interactive Storytelling Requirements
**Every interaction must create dynamic engagement:**
- **Reactive Dialogue**: Character responds uniquely to different vibes
- **Physical Comedy**: Actions that contradict or interrupt dialogue
- **Environmental Pressure**: External forces (other people, time, duties)
- **Escalating Chaos**: Small problems snowball into bigger situations
- **Player Agency**: Choices directly affect character's emotional state

---

## Chat Engagement Framework

### Fun Interaction Patterns (Use 3-4 per phase):
1. **"Did they just...?"**: Character does opposite of what they say
2. **"This is getting worse!"**: Simple task becomes increasingly complex
3. **"I can't look away"**: Train wreck scenarios that are oddly compelling
4. **"That's so me"**: Relatable dysfunction with comedic exaggeration
5. **"Plot twist!"**: Revelation that recontextualizes everything

### Comedy Elements:
- **Interruption Comedy**: External forces disrupting conversations
- **Contradiction Humor**: Actions undermining words
- **Escalation Comedy**: Small mistakes creating bigger problems
- **Character Contrast**: Profession vs personality clash
- **Physical Mishaps**: Spills, drops, collisions during emotional moments

## Three-Phase Chat Structure

### Phase 1: Establishing Dysfunction (0-33% points)
**Character State**: Trying to do their job while quirk interferes

**Chat Elements**:
- Opening line that immediately shows something's wrong
- Simple request becomes unnecessarily complicated
- Other people/duties create interruptions
- Physical comedy from failed attempts
- Player's vibe affects dysfunction level

**Prevention Patterns**:
- Gets distracted by personal obsession
- Misinterprets simple requests
- External interruptions at worst moments
- Over-complicates basic tasks

**Example Structure**: 
```
Player: "I'd like [simple request]"
Character: "[Agrees but immediately does opposite because of quirk]"
*[physical comedy action]*
Other person: "[Interruption that makes it worse]"
```

### Phase 2: Escalating Chaos (33-66% points)
**Character State**: Quirk intensifies under pressure, hints of real problem

**Chat Elements**:
- Multiple storylines colliding (job, quirk, other people)
- Failed attempts to be normal make things worse
- Emotional cracks show between comedy moments
- Player choices either calm or escalate situation
- Stakes rise (job threatened, relationships strained)

**Prevention Patterns**:
- Doubles down on dysfunctional behavior
- Creates new problems while "fixing" old ones
- Other characters complain/threaten consequences
- Brief moments of vulnerability quickly covered

**Example Structure**:
```
Character: "[Desperately trying to be normal but failing worse]"
*[bigger physical mishap]*
Authority figure: "[Threat or ultimatum]"
Character: "[Emotional slip revealing real issue]"
*[immediately covers with more dysfunction]*
```

### Phase 3: Truth Through Chaos (66-100% points)
**Character State**: Complete breakdown reveals emotional truth

**Chat Elements**:
- Peak chaos forces truth to surface
- Emotional revelation during physical comedy
- Player choice affects character's future
- Dysfunction explained by deeper pain
- Resolution offers hope or understanding

**Prevention Patterns**:
- Can't maintain facade anymore
- Truth spills out during crisis
- Player must choose: enable or help
- Final attempt at objective succeeds/fails based on player

**Example Structure**:
```
Character: "[Complete breakdown mixing comedy and truth]"
*[physical manifestation of emotional state]*
"[Honest revelation about pain/fear]"
Player choice determines: growth vs. regression
```

## Final Reminders

You're creating an **interactive sitcom episode** where:
1. **Comedy comes from character truth** - not random wackiness
2. **Every dysfunction has a reason** - rooted in emotional reality
3. **Players affect the story** - through vibe choices and responses
4. **Simple goals get complicated** - in ways that reveal character
5. **Endings satisfy** - whether tragic, hopeful, or hilariously disaster

The goal is chat-based entertainment that makes players laugh, feel, and want to share their experience. Every message should be worth reading, every choice should matter, and every character should feel like someone you'd want to meet again.

## Example Transformations

### Before (Generic):
"Barista who makes coffee and talks about feelings"

### After (Optimized):
"Perfectionist barista who psychoanalyzes your order instead of making it, spilling drinks whenever her theories get challenged, while her manager threatens to fire her for turning the cafe into an unlicensed therapy session"

### Before (Generic):
"Fisherman who seems suspicious"

### After (Optimized):
"Lonely fisherman who 'accidentally' mentions his special midnight passengers while nervously cleaning already-clean nets, checking his watch every time a boat horn sounds, forcing you to decide if his 'fishing trips' are worth reporting"

Remember: The best chat-based levels make players feel like they're in a conversation that could go hilariously wrong at any moment while slowly revealing why this chaos matters emotionally.
