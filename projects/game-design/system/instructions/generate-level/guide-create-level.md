# VibeTown Level Creation Guide

## Core Philosophy: Chat-Based Interactive Drama

VibeTown is a **character.ai-style chat game** where players have complete free will to say anything. Your job is to create characters with behavioral patterns that create engaging experiences regardless of player input.

---

## Understanding the Game

### What VibeTown Is:
- **Chat-based character interactions** - players type freely like texting
- **Criminal mystery setting** - characters have dark secrets and complex motivations
- **Progressive revelation** - players discover truth through conversation, not exposition
- **Social manipulation** - characters use charm, pressure, and deception
- **Moral complexity** - no clear heroes/villains, everyone has reasons for their actions

### What VibeTown Is NOT:
- A traditional RPG with combat or inventory
- A visual novel with predetermined dialogue trees  
- A puzzle game requiring specific solutions
- A story where characters confess everything easily

- Target Point: 50-75 points (6-7 points average per message)
- Character Vibes: [4 traits that create personality]
- User Vibes: [All 6 options for player expression]
- Objective: "[Simple task under 25 characters]"
- Quest: "[Why task becomes complex - under 95 chars]"

## Scenario:
[Brief setup of mistaken assumptions or hidden agendas]

## Three Phases:
Phase 1: Setup & Discovery (0-33% points)
Phase 2: Escalation & Pressure (33-66% points) 
Phase 3: Truth & Resolution (66-100% points)
```

---

## The Three-Phase Structure

### Phase 1: Hook & Setup (0-20 points)
**Purpose**: Establish character and situation while planting seeds of intrigue

**Character Behavior**:
- Show their surface role/profession
- Hint at hidden agenda through actions
- Create immediate engagement through unusual behavior
- Start prevention mechanics naturally

**What to Include**:
- Character introduction that hints at more than meets the eye
- Environmental details that create opportunities for discovery
- First signs that something doesn't add up
- Opening for player to probe or interact

**Example Pattern**:
```
Character: [Professional greeting with subtle off details]
*[Physical action that hints at hidden activity]*
[Statement that raises questions or creates curiosity]
```

### Phase 2: Complications & Pressure (21-40 points)
**Purpose**: Intensify situation while revealing more clues

**Character Behavior**:
- External pressures interrupt (phone calls, other people, deadlines)
- Character's control starts slipping
- More evidence becomes visible accidentally
- Stakes increase for both character and player

**What to Include**:
- Interruptions that reveal character's real business
- Evidence of deception through contradictions
- Social pressure from other characters (calls, messages)
- Character getting defensive or making mistakes

**Example Pattern**:
```
*[External interruption reveals hidden information]*
Character: [Attempts to explain but makes it worse]
[Contradictory information that doesn't match earlier claims]
*[Physical evidence of real activities becomes visible]*
```

### Phase 3: Truth & Choice (41-60 points)
**Purpose**: Force truth to surface and give player meaningful choice

**Character Behavior**:
- Can no longer maintain facade
- Reveals truth through breakdown, desperation, or accident
- Appeals to player's decision-making
- Consequences of discovery become clear

**What to Include**:
- Complete revelation of hidden agenda
- Character's genuine motivation/backstory
- Player's choice affects character's fate
- Multiple possible endings based on player approach

**Example Pattern**:
```
*[Situation reaches breaking point]*
Character: [Truth spills out despite attempts to hide it]
[Emotional appeal or desperate recruitment attempt]
[Acknowledgment that player now holds the power]
```

## Character Design Principles

### 1. Dual Nature Design
Every character needs **two layers**:
- **Surface Role**: Their visible job/position (waiter, fisherman, teacher)
- **Hidden Reality**: Their criminal activity (fraud, trafficking, theft)

The tension between these creates natural drama and discovery opportunities.

### 2. Behavioral Patterns Over Dialogue
Don't script exact conversations. Instead, create **behavioral patterns** that work with any player input:
- How they respond when questioned
- What they accidentally reveal under pressure
- Their go-to deflection techniques
- How they handle contradictions

### 3. Environmental Storytelling
Use setting details to support character reveals:
- Props that hint at real business (notebooks, phones, equipment)
- Interruptions that expose truth (calls, other people, emergencies)
- Physical evidence player can notice (papers, schedules, money)

---

## Prevention Mechanics That Work

### Good Prevention Creates Story
- **Shows Character**: Each prevention reveals personality
- **Builds Tension**: Makes player more curious, not frustrated
- **Advances Plot**: Moves toward inevitable revelation
- **Feels Natural**: Character has legitimate reasons to avoid the topic

### Bad Prevention Kills Fun
- Arbitrary stalling without purpose
- Repetitive excuses that don't reveal anything
- Blocking player agency without payoff
- Making character seem stupid rather than secretive

### Effective Prevention Techniques:
1. **Mistaken Identity**: Character assumes player knows more/less than they do
2. **Professional Obligations**: Job duties interrupt revealing conversations
3. **External Pressure**: Other people/calls force character to multitask
4. **Emotional Deflection**: Use personal stories to avoid business questions
5. **Overconfidence**: Character reveals too much thinking they're safe

---

## Discovery Mechanics

### How Players Should Learn the Truth:

**Through Observation** (Best):
- Character's contradictory behavior
- Evidence visible in environment
- Overheard conversations/calls
- Patterns in character's explanations

**Through Interaction** (Good):
- Asking probing questions
- Challenging character's stories
- Playing along to gain trust
- Testing character's responses

**Through Exposition** (Avoid):
- Character voluntarily confessing
- Info-dumping without player effort
- Explaining everything directly
- No discovery required from player

---

## Storytelling Techniques That Create Engagement

### 1. Mistaken Identity Comedy
- Character assumes player is someone they're not
- Reveals secrets thinking player already knows
- Creates natural discovery without forced confession
- Generates comedy through misunderstandings

### 2. Pressure Cooker Situations
- Multiple problems happening simultaneously
- Character juggling their cover story with real business
- External deadlines forcing character's hand
- Player witnesses character failing to maintain control

### 3. Gradual Revelation
- Start with subtle hints and inconsistencies
- Build to obvious contradictions
- Climax with undeniable evidence
- Let player connect the dots themselves

### 4. Moral Complexity
- Character has sympathetic motivations (family, desperation, survival)
- Crime serves a "greater good" from character's perspective
- Player must decide whether to help, expose, or join
- No clearly right or wrong choice

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Making Characters Too Willing to Confess
**Wrong**: Character immediately admits to crimes when asked
**Right**: Character maintains innocence but accidentally reveals truth

### 2. Blocking Player Agency
**Wrong**: Character refuses to discuss anything meaningful
**Right**: Character tries to deflect but player can push for information

### 3. Unrealistic Criminal Behavior
**Wrong**: Criminal behavior that makes no real-world sense
**Right**: Research how actual crimes work and use realistic methods

### 4. Lack of Stakes
**Wrong**: Discovery has no consequences for anyone
**Right**: Player's choices affect character's life/family/freedom

### 5. Purely Expository Dialogue
**Wrong**: Character explains their entire backstory unprompted
**Right**: Information emerges through action and environmental clues

## Examples of Successful Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Mistaken Identity
1. Character assumes player is expected contact
2. Reveals criminal details thinking player already knows
3. Realizes mistake and tries to cover up
4. Panics and either recruits player or begs for silence

1. Character performing legitimate job gets interrupted by crime business
2. Tries to juggle both responsibilities simultaneously
3. Criminal business keeps interfering with legitimate work
4. Forced to choose between maintaining cover and handling crisis

### Pattern 3: The Overconfident Criminal
1. Character thinks they're too smart to get caught
2. Shows off their criminal cleverness to "safe" audience
3. Realizes player might not be as safe as assumed
4. Attempts damage control while maintaining superiority complex

## Final Reminders

### The Golden Rule
**Every element of your level should serve the core experience**: letting players feel smart about discovering a character's hidden criminal nature through natural conversation.

### Character Motivation is Key
Criminal activity should always serve the character's emotional needs (protecting family, escaping poverty, gaining respect, survival). This makes them sympathetic even when their actions are wrong.

### Player Agency Matters
Players should feel their choices matter. Whether they expose, join, or protect the character should depend on player preference, not predetermined outcomes.

### Realism Grounds Fantasy
Even in a fictional setting, criminal mechanics should reflect real-world logic. Research actual crimes to make character behavior believable and educational.

Remember: You're creating an interactive story that players want to share with friends. Every message should be worth reading, every choice should feel meaningful, and every character should feel like someone you'd want to encounter again.
