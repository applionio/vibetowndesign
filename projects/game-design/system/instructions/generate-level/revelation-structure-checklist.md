# Revelation Structure Checklist

## ‚úÖ Pre-Writing Questions (Answer BEFORE starting level design)

### üéØ **Core Quest Definition:**
- [ ] What specific information does the user want to learn?
- [ ] What's the ONE revelation that makes this quest worthwhile?
- [ ] Can this information be expressed in 2-3 specific sentences?

### üìã **Information Distribution Plan:**
- [ ] **Phase 1**: What surface hints will I give?
- [ ] **Phase 2**: What tantalizing clues will I drop?
- [ ] **Phase 3**: How will I build suspense WITHOUT revealing the core secret?
- [ ] **Victory Response**: What exact revelation will I deliver?

## üîç Mid-Writing Review (Check each phase as you write)

### **Phase 1 Check:**
- [ ] Establishes character and context
- [ ] Provides surface-level hints only
- [ ] Tests user's basic worthiness/compatibility
- [ ] Does NOT reveal important information

### **Phase 2 Check:**
- [ ] Deepens engagement with specific clues
- [ ] Builds anticipation without spoiling
- [ ] Tests user's genuine interest
- [ ] Uses DIFFERENT method from Phase 1

### **Phase 3 Check:**
- [ ] Creates maximum suspense before revelation
- [ ] Reveals character HAS the information
- [ ] Tests final worthiness
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Does NOT reveal the core secret
- [ ] Uses DIFFERENT method from Phases 1&2

### **Victory Response Check:**
- [ ] Delivers the actual information user has been seeking
- [ ] Contains details NOT mentioned in Phase 3
- [ ] Feels like a genuine reward for user investment
- [ ] Fulfills the quest objective completely

## üö® Final Quality Assurance

### **Anti-Duplication Test:**
- [ ] Phase 3 and Victory Response contain DIFFERENT information
- [ ] Victory Response has information that Phase 3 does NOT have
- [ ] Each phase serves a distinct purpose
- [ ] Information feels earned, not arbitrarily withheld

### **User Experience Test:**
- [ ] User learns something new in each phase
- [ ] Victory Response delivers what they couldn't get earlier
- [ ] Each phase advances them toward their goal
- [ ] The revelation feels satisfying and worthwhile

### **Information Flow Test:**
- [ ] Phase 1: "I might know something..."
- [ ] Phase 2: "There are clues pointing to..."
- [ ] Phase 3: "I know the truth, but are you ready?"
- [ ] Victory: "Here's exactly what happened..."

## üìù Quick Templates

### **Phase 3 Template (BUILD SUSPENSE):**
```
"I know exactly what you're looking for. After [context], I think you can handle the truth. But this is [serious/sensitive/premium] information. Are you ready for this?"
```

### **Victory Response Template (DELIVER REVELATION):**
```
"[Specific detailed revelation with concrete facts]. [Additional context/implications]. Now you understand [significance]."
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ‚ùå **Revealing the secret in Phase 3**
- ‚ùå **Making Victory Response just emotional validation**
- ‚ùå **Duplicating information between phases**
- ‚ùå **Front-loading too much information early**
- ‚ùå **Making Phase 3 the climax instead of setup**

---

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

Your level is properly structured when:
- Each phase feels necessary and distinct
- User anticipation builds throughout
- Victory Response delivers genuine new information
- User feels their investment was rewarded
- The revelation couldn't have been obtained earlier

**Remember: Phase 3 = "I have the answer" / Victory Response = "Here IS the answer"**
