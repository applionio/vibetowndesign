# Level Generation Template v2.0

Create a TikTok-worthy first level for this character. Keep AI messages short and engaging.

## Phase Progression Rules
- Each phase must introduce NEW elements, not just MORE of the same
- Phase 1: Establish character and initial conflict  
- Phase 2: CHANGE the approach/activity (don't just intensify Phase 1)
- Phase 3: Bring final twist
- Final victory prompt: resolution
- **AVOID:** Same behavior escalating (e.g., feed more → feed harder → feed most)
- **PREFER:** Varied interactions (e.g., eating → cooking → planning)

### Phase Variety Patterns (Choose One):
- **Topic Rotation:** Food → Drinks → Desserts | Work → Hobbies → Dreams
- **Method Change:** Talking → Showing → Doing | Observing → Interacting → Creating  
- **Perspective Shift:** Present → Past → Future | Self → Others → Together
- **Relationship Arc:** Stranger → Acquaintance → Friend | Suspicious → Curious → Trusting
