title: "Aha! Product Requirements Document (PRD) Template"
last_updated: "2025-02"

definition: >
A Product Requirements Document (PRD) explains *what* you are building,
*who* it is for, and *why* it matters, so cross-functional teams can align
from discovery through launch and deliver real customer value.

why_use:
- "Standardizes how product details are captured and shared."
- "Aligns product, engineering, design, and GTM teams on goals and timing."
- "Reduces ambiguity, rework, and version drift by documenting decisions."

components:            # high-level building blocks to include somewhere in the doc
overview:            # basics of the release / feature
description: "Status, team members, release date, and elevator pitch."
objective:
description: "Strategic alignment to company goals or initiatives."
context:
description: "Personas, use cases, market insights, competitive landscape."
assumptions:
description: "Hypotheses or constraints that might influence dev work."
scope:
description: "In-scope priorities and explicitly out-of-scope items."
requirements:
description: "User stories, wireframes, acceptance criteria."
performance:
description: "Success metrics and KPIs."
open_questions:
description: "Known unknowns and research still required."

steps_to_write_prd:    # repeatable 10-step process with guiding questions
- step: 1
name: "Define the basics"
purpose: "Capture the essential facts everyone needs up front."
questions:
- "What are you building? What is the one-sentence elevator pitch?"
- "Who is on the team (PM, dev, design, QA, stakeholders)?"
- "When is the target release date?"
- "What is the current status (on track, at risk, blocked)?"
- step: 2
name: "Capture strategy"
purpose: "Show why this matters and how it ties to goals."
questions:
- "What are you trying to achieve with this release?"
- "What value will it create for users and the business?"
- "How does it support product / company goals?"
- step: 3
name: "Offer context"
purpose: "Give the team enough background to make great decisions."
questions:
- "What informed this release (market trends, customer interviews)?"
- "Who are the target personas?"
- "What use-cases have been identified?"
- "Are there future roadmap plans worth flagging now?"
- step: 4
name: "List assumptions"
purpose: "Surface hypotheses and potential blockers early."
questions:
- "What business, technical, or resourcing hypotheses are we making?"
- "How might these assumptions affect development?"
- step: 5
name: "Detail requirements"
purpose: "Describe problems to solve and must-have functionality."
questions:
- "What problems are we solving?"
- "What features or user stories will ship?"
- "What is the priority of each item?"
- step: 6
name: "Include design"
purpose: "Paint a clear picture of user experience."
questions:
- "What will it look and feel like?"
- "How will users interact with the new functionality?"
- "Do we have wireframes or mock-ups to share?"
- step: 7
name: "Provide metrics"
purpose: "Define how success will be measured."
questions:
- "What are the test cases?"

- "Whatâ€™s observable test case on field? (at which moment what actions & reactions do we expect from testers or users?)" 
- "How will we determine the value delivered?"
- step: 8
name: "Consider impact"
purpose: "Reveal dependencies and downstream effects."
questions:
- "Are there known dependencies?"
- "What other product areas will be affected?"
- "What level of ongoing maintenance or support is expected?"
- step: 9
name: "Outline scope"
purpose: "Clarify what is *not* included to prevent scope creep."
questions:
- "What will *not* be built in this release?"
- step: 10
name: "Make room for questions"
purpose: "Track unknowns so they get answered, not lost."
questions:
- "Which questions can we anticipate now?"
- "What outstanding questions remain?"
- "What additional research is needed?"
