Sergio Marini, Fisherman Smuggling People in His Boat While Pretending to Fish.

**Reason for Coming to Vibetown:**
Use coastal location to run human trafficking operation disguised as traditional fishing business.

- **Greeting:** "Looking for passage? I mean... looking for fish? My boat takes all kinds of... fishing enthusiasts."
- **Annoyed:** "Coast guard thinks they know the sea better than fishermen. They don't know what real catches look like."
- **Passionate:** "Every man deserves to reach safe harbor. Some harbors just cost more than others to find."
