    # PASTE THE FIRST-DRAFT LEVEL STORY HERE.
    # For example:
    #
    # Hey newcomer! ðŸ‘‹
    # Everyone's been buzzing about you joining us!
    # I'm Eleanor and I just HAD to say hi first! âœ¨
    # ... (rest of the draft) ...

  task: |
    Thank you but I think it misses something. Can you please revise the story provided in the context above with the following goals:

    1.  **Make it like a viral TikTok video hook:** The opening and subsequent interactions should be immediately engaging, surprising, or funny to grab attention.
    2.  **Make characters more relatable and cool:** Their dialogue and actions should feel modern, authentic, and less like generic NPCs.
    3.  **Keep the text short and punchy:** People get bored of long text. Edit for brevity.
    4.  **Add surprises:** Introduce unexpected twists or moments to get more "likes" and keep the player hooked.

    Return only the revised, final version of the level story.
